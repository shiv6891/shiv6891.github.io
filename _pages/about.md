Hi! 

I am a Postdoctoral researcher at UKP Lab, TU Darmstadt.

Broadly interested in NLP and Multimodal AI. Currently working on Contextual and Applied Multimodal Reasoning with emphasis on hetrogenous data types.

I pursued my PhD at IIT Delhi, and my thesis revolves around analyzing and characterizing Harmfulness within memes. Besides staring at memes that are both funny and outrageous, I primarily explore various computational solutions involving multimodality and LLMs towards modeling the affective dimensions that enable characterisation and contextualisation of harmful memes. 

Specifically, I'm looking into aspects related to:

<ul>
  <li> Harmful Meme Detection</li> 
  <li> Narrative Role Labelling in Harmful Memes</li> 
  <li> Memetic Contextualisation (NLE/multimodal-QA)</li>
  <li> Representation Learning for Memetic Applications (Self-supervised and Affect-enriched Learning)</li>  
</ul>

Before my ongoing PhD program, I did my masters in the broader domain of Speech Signal Processing, focusing on "A Study on Infant Vocalizations towards Classification of Paraâ€“linguistic Sounds".
